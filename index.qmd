## Abstract {#abstract}

  Poker may be a game of incomplete information, but the modern table is overflowing with data, stack depths, bet sizes, board textures, and the subtle gaps between pot odds and real equity that separate a solid value bet from an expensive bluff. My goal was to capture that information while the chips are still moving, enrich it with fast analytics, and surface insights quickly enough to influence live play.

  To do this I built an R shiny \"Poker EV tool\". This app   replaces the scratch pad notetaking with an end-to-end pipeline that follows the classic data-science staircase.

Data → Tidy → Transform → Model → Visualize → Communicate

-   Collect: Live inputs for each action plus a drag and drop import of PokerStars Text logs and Holdem Manager Spreadsheets.

-   Tidy and Transform: Every hand explodes into a long table of atomic actions, then gains derived fields, running pot size, pot odds, equity proxies and street level expected value.

-   Model: A two-state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) flags likely bluff in real time; a custom optimality score ranks who\'s profiting and who is leaking.

-   Visualize and Communicate. One click reveals stack-versus-pot area charts, an aggression bubble plot, per-player EV trends, and plain English bullet summaries to be digested by a general audience.

  The result is a tool that turns raw hand histories into actionable coaching notes in seconds, setting the stage for deeper Monte-Carlo equity engines, live dashboards, and what-if simulators outlined later in this report.

  The Poker Data Recorder squarely tackles the talent-management functions that matter most at the table. It turns every action into equity versus odds metrics, an HMM-based bluff rate, and a single Optimality score, giving you rigorous player evaluation and prospect assessment in minutes rather than hours. Because the summaries call out who is leaking EV and how, the app also serves as a player-development aid; coaches can hand a struggling grinder a bullet-point list of specific leaks to plug. The live EV trend and aggression bubble plot feed directly into on-field strategy and real-time decision making: you instantly see whether to isolate, avoid, or lean on a given opponent. At the group level these same metrics help with light personnel decisions such as who to stake, who to bench, or how to seat friends in a home game, nudging you toward an optimized roster value. Functions that hinge on external bankroll contracts, such as full trade analysis, roster construction, asset valuation, and formal player acquisition strategy, sit outside the app\'s current scope, but the rich performance data it produces would be the natural input for those higher-level front-office tools.
