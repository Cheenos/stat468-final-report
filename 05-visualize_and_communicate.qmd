# Visualizing and Communication {#V&C}

Once every action is enriched with equity, EV, bluff-probability, and stack context, we use 3 key plots to surface patterns at a glance. All code lives in the server file's **renderplot()** calls.

### Stack and Plot Volume Area Chart

This chart shows how each player's stack evolves hand-by-hand alongside the total pot size.

### Aggression Bubble Plot

The aggression bubble plot distils each player's betting profile into a single point using four visual channels:

1.  Horizontal Axis (x = Average Pot odds) The mean price a player has paid for calls, bets, and raises. Lower values indicate cheaper bets (tighter play) wile higher values signal looser, more speculative actions.
2.  Vertical axis ( y = Average Equity) The mean hand strength (equity) when they chose to invest. Higher values reveal a focus on value spots whereas lower values suggest frequent "chasing" of draws or marginal holdings.
3.  Bubble Area (size = \# of bets & raises) Encodes aggression volume. Large bubbles show players who bet or raise often, small bubbles mark those who pick their spots more conservatively.
4.  Colour Gradient (colour = Bluff Rate) A sky blue -\> firebrick spectrum highlights how often a player's actions fall into the bluff state as estimated by the HMM. Blue tones denote disciplined, predominantly value-driven play, red tones flag high bluff propensity.

##### Interpretation Tips

-   The 45° dashed line is the break-even baseline: any bubble above it represents a player whose average equity exceeded average price paid---i.e., +EV play.
-   A large blue bubble high and to the left signals a "solid reg" who bets often but primarily in value spots.
-   A large red bubble low and to the right reveals a "spewy bluffer" whose aggression outpaces hand quality.
-   Clusters often emerge: tight-aggressive ("TAG") players form a medium-sized, moderately red cluster above the line; tight-passive players hug the lower-left, small-light bubbles; and loose players scatter rightward with varied colours.

##### Why This Works

-   Multidimensional view: condenses four metrics into a single, intuitive chart.
-   Immediate outlier detection: extreme bubbles and positioning jump out, guiding coaches where to focus.
-   Comparative benchmarking: everyone shares the same axes, making peers comparisons trivial.

### EV Scatter Plot

For a selected player, we chart per-action EV over time. A zero-EV dashed highlights wins versus losses.

##### Key elements

1.  Hand Number (x-axis). Chronological order of hands lets you see hot and cold streaks.
2.  EV per Action (y-axis). Positive value denote "+EV" decisions; negative values indicate chip losing moves
3.  Colour = Action type. Differentiates Calls, bets, and raises so you can spot which action type carries the most variance.

### Optimal Table and Headline Summary

The Optimality Table ranks each player by their composite "Optimality" score and lays out the three components that feed into it, EV Edge, Bet/Raise Rate and Bluff Rate, so you can pinpoint exactly why one player sits above or below another. By presenting why one player sits above or below another. - EV Edge (= Average Equity -- Avg Pot Odds) shows pure decision quality.

-   Bet/Raise Rate (= Aggressive Actions/Hands Played) measures how often a player seizes spots.
-   Bluff Rate (= Mean HMM Bluff Probability) captures their discipline with inpaired or weak holdings
-   Optimality multiplies those three factors into one number, so a high-scoring player must excel on all fronts

Immediately next to the table, the Headline Summary pulls out the story in two sentences:

![](or.png){fig-alt="Showcase of Optimality" fig-cap="Showcase of Optimality"}

This detailed table plus a concise, human read-able paragraph ensures that both data savvy coaches and casual observers instantly grasp who's excelling, who is leaking chips and which levers each player should pull to improve.
